# SheWorks – A Job & Opportunity Platform for Women
SheWorks is a web platform designed exclusively for women belonging to three categories:
- Fresh Graduates & Post-Graduates entering the workforce
- Women restarting careers after a break
- Women rejoining in their late 30s looking for flexible or skill-aligned roles

The platform allows companies, communities, and mentors to host jobs, internships, events, webinars, workshops, and more—similar to Unstop—but specifically tailored to support women's career journeys.

🎯 Problem Statement
Many women face barriers in accessing suitable jobs, skill-building opportunities, and professional communities due to gaps in experience, lack of mentorship, or career breaks. Existing job portals are not tailored to female-focused challenges and do not provide holistic support.
SheWorks aims to bridge this gap by offering a curated platform that combines jobs, events, training, and community building—exclusively for women.

🎯 Objectives
- Provide a dedicated job portal for women at different career stages
- Enable companies to host roles, events, webinars, training programs
- Offer skill development suggestions via integrations (UpGrad, GFG, Scaler, Coursera, etc.)
- Build a community through clubs, meetups & mentorship circles
- Ensure secure, smooth access through role-based authentication
- Provide recommendation engines for personalized career paths
